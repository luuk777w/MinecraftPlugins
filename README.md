# MinecraftPlugins

There are two plugins in this repository.

# 1. Anti block place plugin:
That exists out of antiblock.java and blocklisner.java

The Idea of this plugin is that if you have permissions, you can build and brake and if you dont have those permissions you can not build and brake stuff.

# 2. RandomTP
This is just the RandomTP.java file.

What this plugin does is random teleport you.
There is a command "/randomtp" what teleports you between 100 and 5100 blocks in x and z direction.
